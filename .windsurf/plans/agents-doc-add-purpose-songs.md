# AGENTS.md purpose/songs update

Add a short purpose paragraph and clarify song types covered in AGENTS.md to orient agents on project intent and data scope.

- Summarize project purpose in one concise paragraph (interactive bilingual timeline connecting Israeli hip-hop with conflicts; neutrality and sourcing emphasized).
- Specify song types included (studio releases, singles, notable collabs, politically contextual tracks, submissions) and what’s excluded (off-topic/no-clear-date, non-hip-hop unless tied to the scene).
- Insert the new content near the top of AGENTS.md under a dedicated heading (e.g., “Purpose & Scope”).
- Keep tone neutral and concise; avoid duplicating existing architecture/ops content.
