      reason: 'The early 2010s were marked by two major military operations in Gaza: Pillar of Defense (2012) and Protective Edge (2014). These conflicts, along with the ongoing blockade and rocket fire, created a constant state of tension and trauma. The music of this era reflects a deep sense of fatigue with the violence, a critique of political leadership, and a search for meaning amidst the chaos.',

      title: 'Wave of Violence & Great March of Return',
      reason: 'This period saw a shift from large-scale military operations to more individual acts of violence during the \'Stabbing Intifada\' (2015-2016). The latter part of the decade was defined by the Great March of Return protests at the Gaza border. The music reflects these tensions, with themes of bodily autonomy, social protest, and a critique of the ongoing occupation and societal divisions.',
